# NUMBERS

https://mohanmohadikar.github.io/NUMBERS/

In this game you need to arrange numbers 1 to 15 in grid in increasing order.<br/>
I have simply used 16 buttons to create grid for this game.<br/>
When we start game, grid numbers are arranged in random order.<br/>
With the help of CSS,  I've added design to buttons in project along with some howering effect<br/>
